# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a JavaScript Extention allowing us to utilize both HTML and JS within the same .JS file. The main syntax difference is that when we utilize JS code within JSX the JS function should be called with curly brackets surrounding it. 

Researched answer: JavaScript XML is a JS extention allowing you to write HTML style syntax within JS code. JSX is mainly used within frameworks such as React to describe structure and appearance for UI. A big difference between HTML and JSX is the use of classes. in HTML you would use class, but in JSX you would use className to avoid conflict with a JavaScript reserved keyword.

1. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is a package handler for JS that allows you to install certain snippets of useful code that someone has previously created and allowed for open source to help programmer by modifying your muultiple files to give you the tools needed for a current project.

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager that manages dependencies, install packages, and handle configurations.  The main file that is modified is the Json file that acts as the manifest for your project.

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: A React comeponent is a reusable piece of code stored separately from your parent App which can be called upon multiple times. 

Researched answer: React components allow you to contain logic and structure required to render part of the UI. With components being independent to the main code they allow you to manage your code easier.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: States are used to store data that can change overtime, props are used to pass information from the parent to child components.

Researched answer: Props are immutable and are used for the child components to access data from the parent component. States are local data which are then managed by a component. States are mutable and are easily updated through the setState hook. 

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer:  The DOM is like a tree like structure and give a way to interact with the webpage allowing constant changes. 

Researched answer: The DOM is the Document Object Model and acts as an interface for HTML and XML. It allows each element in a document to be represented as an object, manipulating the content and structure of a webpage at runtime. 

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: I have no idea what a span tag is.

Researched answer: Both tags are HTML elements but have different styling behaviors and purposes. The div tag acts as a container to group and organize elements. The span tage is an inline level element allowing styling to used to manipulate test within a large block of information. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: OOP allows you to organize code into objects which are the outcome of classes providing dynamic structure and design based on objects interacting with another to perform set tasks. 

2. Ruby: Ruby is another dynamic and open source object-oriented scripting language that is used in the backend portion of computer programming. 

3. Implicit return: Implicit return is basically shorthand syntax where the expression on the right side of an arrow function is treated as the return allowing us to ommit the return statement. 

4. Ruby blocks: These are pieces of code that can pass through a method to be executed. Contains behavior and passes as an argument. Mainly used for ruby iteration. 

5. Ruby hashes: Ruby hashes are similar to objects in JavaScript as a has is a specific data structure that allows you to store information as key-value pairs.
